# ðŸ‘‘ Crown.JS ðŸ‘‘

A JavaScript library that simplifies the creation of canvas games

## Description

I went through a phase of creating tons of little canvas games in JavaScript. I had noticed that I had reused tons of code with each game, so I had created Crown.JS to streamline this process. Aside from quicker game creation, I also gave Crown.JS a couple of features like smooth cameras (with shake) and TWEENs in order to give canvas games the same level of fluidity experienced by games made in professional engines.

## Features

* Smooth movement through TWEENs
* Three different sample projects
* Easily expandable object-oriented design
* Dynamic camera with shake
* Culling of objects outside the camera
* Support for "static" objects that are only drawn one time
* Easy handling of JavaScripts and more tedious things such as initialization or rendering. 

## Getting Started

Crown.JS is stored in one simple header this means you just need to drag the header and include it in your HTML file right before your game scripts.

### Learning guide

The quickest way to get started is to read the [documentation](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/--Crown.JS/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#documentation) or take a look at the [sample projects](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/--Crown.JS/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#example-projects)

### Quickstart

* First thing you need to do get your canvas and context. After that you can create an input controller that will handle all of your keybaord input in the project
```
const canvas = document.querySelector("#game");
const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
const i = new InputController();
```
* Once you have these three things you can create the game object. This game object handles the rendering, camera, and adding objects
```
const game = new Game(canvas, ctx, i);
```
* Now you need to call the games update method in a loop like like this:
```
function update(){
    game.update();
    window.requestAnimationFrame(update);
}
```
* From there you can set up a input system with onKeyPressed() and onKeyPressedRepeat(). Or you could try to set up your game world with addActor() and addStaticActor()

## Example Projects
### Inversion: 

Originally created in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/571692328/) and featured on the news by Hour Of Code. It is definitely the best example project to start with and probably the cleanest. It can be found in index.html and main.js

### grapher.js

This was created as a way to showcase the smooth movement functionality of Crown.JS. Its source code is in grapher.html and grapher.js.

### spacegame

A little test put together to push Crown.JS to its limits. With completly dynamic graphics it shows how you can blend your own custom code with Crown.JS. While its not the best example of using Crown.JS to guide your project is a func little demo I coded up and had a lot of fun making.

## Documentation

This documentation was created to outline Crown.JS and all of its features. This is more of a reference guide. If you are looking to quick start look at [getting started](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/--Crown.JS/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) or [example projects](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/--Crown.JS/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#example-projects).

### The Game Object

class Game(HTMLCanvas canvas, CanvasContext2d ctx, [InputController](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/--Crown.JS/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#the-inputcontroller) input)

The Game object is the foundatation for Crown.JS and mainly exists to render and create actors.

#### properties
* canvas : the canvas passed too the constructor
* ctx : the ctx pass too the constructor
* tweenList : a list of all active [TWEENs](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/--Crown.JS?tab=readme-ov-file#the-tween-object)
* backgroundColor : A string that defines the background color of the canvas
* offScreenCanvas : the canvas that static actors are drawn to. Created with the Game object
* offCtx : the ctx of game.offScreenCanvas
* input : the [InputController](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/--Crown.JS?tab=readme-ov-file#the-tween-object) passed to the game
* camera : The [Camera](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/--Crown.JS?tab=readme-ov-file#the-tween-object) object for the game. Created with the Game object

#### Methods
##### addActor
Add Actor creates a new actor and automatically will start rendering it. Extra parameters can be passed through params such as: Bool "bottom" (renders sprite below others) and String "group" (sets the group for that actor) 
```
void addActor(String name, Sprite sprite, Object params={})
```

#### addStaticActor
Similar to add actor this draws the actor to the offScreenCanvas. It can be used for things like background images or other static things. 
```
void addStaticActor(String name, Sprite sprite, vectorObject pos, Object params={})
```

#### findActor
Finds an actor by name
```
Actor findActor(String name)
```

#### update
The update function must be called every frame and is the foundatation for Crown.JS
```
void update()
```

##### destroy
This function should be used to remove a actor from the game world
```
void destroy(Actor Object)
```

#### pauseInput
pauseInput disables the game's input temporarily.  The sister function of resumeInput()
```
void pauseInput()
```

#### resumeInput
resumeInput re-enables the game's input.  The sister function of pauseInput()
```
void resumesInput()
```

#### destroyGroup
This function calls destroy() for every single actor in a group.
```
void destroyGroup(String group)
```

#### addToGroup
This function allows you to add an actor to an existing group
```
void addToGroup(String group, Actor() actor)
```

#### getGroup
This function allows you get every single actor in a group
```
Actor[] getGroup(String name)
```

#### addTween
Creates a [TWEEN](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/--Crown.JS?tab=readme-ov-file#the-tween-object) that will be automatically updated. The recomended way to handle TWEENs
```
void addTween(double start, double end, TWEENAlgorithm algo, void function endFunc, double speed) 
```

### The Actor Object

class Actor(String name, [Sprite](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/--Crown.JS/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#the-sprite-object) sprite, CanvasContext2d ctx)

The actor represents a [Sprite](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/--Crown.JS/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#the-sprite-object) with a position and scale. It should not be created without using [addActor](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/--Crown.JS/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#addactor)

#### properties
* name : the name of the sprite
* sprite : the [Sprite](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/--Crown.JS/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#the-sprite-object) tied to this actor
* pos : a [vectorObject](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/--Crown.JS/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#vector-object) with x and y properties
* rot : the rotation of the actor
* scale : a [vectorObject](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/--Crown.JS/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#vector-object) with x and y properties
* culled : this value is read-only and can be used to tell if the actor is being rendered

#### Methods

#### scaleBy
scales the sprite by n times. Good because it updates both the sprites scale and the scale used for collisions 
```
void scaleBy(double n) 
```

#### onUpdate
Called every single frame. Has not body and is meant to be overidden
```
void onUpdate() 
```
#### onSpriteLoaded
Similar to onUpdate() it is meant to be overidden. Called when the sprite is loaded. It is not recomended to modify the sprite at all before onSpriteLoaded is called.
```
void onSpriteLoaded()
```
#### onCreate
This function in f will be called instantally and is more for looks than anything
```
onCreate(function f)
```

### The Sprite Object

The Sprite object is not technically an object instead it is defined by having a render function.
#### properties
* loaded : a boolean value of whether or not its loaded
* opacity : the opacity of the sprite
* scale : the scale of the sprite. Should match with the actor for proper collision

#### varations

#### BoxGeometry
```
BoxGeometry(double scale, String color="black")
```
##### extra properties:
* color : a string the color

#### RectGeometry
```
RectGeometry(double x, double y, String color="black")
```
##### extra properties:
* color : a string the color
* rot : the rotatation of the rect

#### Line
```
Line(double length, double width)
```
##### extra properties:
* color : a string the lines color (default black)
* end : the end of the line (stored as a [vectorObject](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/--Crown.JS/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#vector-object))
* start : the start of the line (stored as a [vectorObject](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/--Crown.JS/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#vector-object))
* rot : the rotation of the line
* length : length of a line
* width : width of a line

#### CircleGeometry
```
CircleGeometry(double scale, String color="black")
```
##### extra properties:
* color : a string of the circles color

#### Sprite
```
Sprite(String src, vectorObject scale)
```
##### extra properties:
* img : the image object tied to the sprite
* rot : the rotatation of the sprite

### The InputController

class InputController()

The input controller is meant to handle keyboard and mouse controls in your project

#### properties
* paused : a boolean value of whether the input will trigger events
* mouse : a vectorObject of the mouse

#### Methods

#### onMouseDown
the function f will be called every click
```
void onMouseDown(function f) 
```

#### onMouseMove
A function meant to be overridden. Called every time the mouse moves
```
void onMouseMove()
```

#### onKeyPressed
Creates a an event and calls the function f every time the key gets pressed
```
void onKeyPressed(String key, function f)
```

#### onKeyPressedRepeat
Creates a an event and calls the function f every frame where the key is down
```
void onKeyPressedRepeat(String key, function f)
```

#### clearKey
Removes the keypress event tied to the key
```
void clearKey(String key)
```

#### clearKeys
Calls clearKey() for an array of keys
```
void clearKeys(String[] keys)
```

### The Camera object

The Camera Object is automatically created by the [game](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/--Crown.JS/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#the-game-object) and can be accessed through game.camera

class Camera(Double startX, Double startY, HTMLCanvas canvas)

#### properties
* pos : a read-only [vectorObject](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/--Crown.JS/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#vector-object) that shows the current position of the camera
* target : a [vectorObject](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/--Crown.JS/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#vector-object) that holds the target that the camera will move towards
* dampening : how fast the shaking stops (default 3)
* drag : how fast the camera moves towards the target (default 0.3)
* culling : boolean of whether the camera will hide actors outside the view of the camera

#### Methods

#### shake
Shakes the camera
```
void shake(double strength)
```

### The Sound object

This object is pretty seperate from the rest of Crown.JS just made for playing sounds.

class Sound(String src, Boolean loop=false, function onFinished=undefined)

#### Methods

#### play
Starts playing the sound
```
void play()
```

#### pause
Stops the sound. Has the option to restart it
```
void pause(Boolean restart=false)
```
### Utilities
A collection of functions in utils.js. Seperate from the rest of Crown.JS but just as useful

#### vectorObject
The vectorObject is used by Crown.JS to comunicate scale and position. This means you cannot call actor.x instead actor.pos.x. Same thing with width and height. It simply is a standard Javascript object defined like this:
```
vectorObject = {double x, double y}
```
#### CROWN_RANDOM_FUNC 
This is a constant function pointer that allows the user to override the random function. Useful for seeded random or coordinating random values across a server Defaults to Math.random

#### actorsCollide
Checks if two actors collide. This uses the scale property of the actor not its sprite.
```
Boolean actorsCollide(Actor act1, Actor act2)
```

#### VecSub
Subtracts two [vectorObjects](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/--Crown.JS?tab=readme-ov-file#vector-object) and returns a new one
```
vectorObject VecSub(vectorObject a, vectorObject b)
```

#### randFromArr
Gets a random element from an array. Uses [CROWN_RANDOM_FUNC](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/--Crown.JS?tab=readme-ov-file#crown_random_func)
```
typeof(arr[0]) randFromArr(Array arr)
```

#### randInRange
Get a random Integer in the range of min (inclusive) and max (exclusive). Uses [CROWN_RANDOM_FUNC](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/--Crown.JS?tab=readme-ov-file#crown_random_func)
```
Integer randInRange(Integer min, Integer max)
```

#### randFloatInRange
Same as randInRange but uses a Float instead. Uses [CROWN_RANDOM_FUNC](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/--Crown.JS?tab=readme-ov-file#crown_random_func)
```
Double randFloatInRange(Double x, Double y)
```

#### addPointer
An odd name for a function as its not a conventional pointer. Instead its a variable that gets added to the window with a custom getter/setter. This new global variable can be used just like any. So this means code like this: 
```
addPointer("x", 10, ()=>{alert("hello)})
x = 10 // alerts hello
```
Will create a new variable x and set it to 10. Think of it as being the equivlent of:
```
var x = 10;
function changeX(v){
  x = v;
  alert("hello");
}
changeX(10); // alerts hello
```
The calling convention for this function is:
```
void addPointer(String name, any value, function onChange)
```

#### numWithLength
Formats a number so that is is an n character string
```
String numWithLength(Integer num, Integer n)
```

#### lerp
Basic linear interpolation function.
```
Double lerp(Double a, Double b, Double t)
```

#### The TWEEN object
The tween object contains all of the logic behind the [addTween()](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/--Crown.JS?tab=readme-ov-file#addtween) function. One should not manually create TWEENs but it can be useful to know excatly how they work.

class TWEEN(Double start, Double end, function f, TWEENAlgorithm algo, function endFunc=unefined, double speed=0.01)

#### properties
* t : the current time
* rate : the speed of the TWEEN passed through the speed parameter

#### Methouds

#### step
called to step the TWEEN forward by one. 
```
void step()
```

#### TWEEN Algorithms
TWEEN algorithms are a set of functions that all take in the value of t and returns a new value. They can be used to modify the behavior of a TWEEN. It is recomended you use the [grapher.js](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/--Crown.JS/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#grapherjs) example to see how they behave.

* constantSpeed : returns t
* squared : returns t * t
* easeInCubic : returns t * t * t
* squareRoot : returns sqrt(t)
* quadEaseOut : returns  1 - (1 - t) * (1 - t)
* parabola : converts t into a parabola type shape
* triangle : goes in a triangle
* elasticOut : Math.sin(-13 * (t + 1) * (Math.PI/2)) * Math.pow(2, -10 * t) + 1
* bounceOut : has t bounce at the end
* smoothstep : the smoothstep function
* easeOutQuint : ease out
* easeInBounce : bounce is at the start instead of end
* elasticIn : equivelent of easeInBounce but with elasticOut

If you wish to create your own TWEEN algorithm make sure the prototype looks like this:
```
double customAlgo(double t)
```
After that just pass it to [addTween()](https://github.com/KingstumusPrime/--Crown.JS?tab=readme-ov-file#addtween)
